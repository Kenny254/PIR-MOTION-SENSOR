# PIR-MOTION-SENSOR
ARDUINO PIR SENSOR 


Connecting PIR sensors to a microcontroller is really simple. The PIR acts as a digital output, it can be high voltage or low voltage, so all you need to do is listen for the pin to flip high (detected) or low (not detected) by listening on a digital input on your Arduino

Its likely that you'll want reriggering, so be sure to put the jumper in the H position!

Power the PIR with 5V and connect ground to ground. Then connect the output to a digital pin. In this example we'll use pin 2.
